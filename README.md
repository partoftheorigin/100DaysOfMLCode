# #100DaysOfMLCode

My journey through 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge

### Day 1
- Started working on Entity Extraction.
- I will be using bi-LSTM + CRF with character embeddings for NER and POS.
- Reading: https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html
- Repo: https://github.com/partoftheorigin/EntityExtraction

### Day 2
- Almost done with Sequence Tagging.
- Repo: https://github.com/partoftheorigin/EntityExtraction/blob/master/LSTM_CRF_Twitter_NER.ipynb

### Day 3
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Research papers:
  1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04560v2.pdf
  2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf
  3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01450.pdf

### Day 4
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Attended a MeetUp on Getting to the Core of Deep Learning.
- Still understanding the underlying concepts and approaches of the research papers so that we can create our own model from scratch.

### Day 5
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Experimenting with SQuAD2.0 The Stanford Question Answering Dataset

### Day 6
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Started implementation of Context based Question-Answering model based on NeuralQA paper for Stanford SQuAd Dataset.
- Preparing data now.

### Day 7
- Continuing work on Neural Question Answer Generation.
- Processing SQuAd Dataset to get it ready for training.
- Once the data is ready I will create word embeddings using GloVe.

### Day 8
- Working on Neural QA.
- Preprocessed and saved data to be used afterwards for training.
- Creating word embeddings using GloVe.
- Repo: https://github.com/partoftheorigin/NeuralQuestionAnswer

### Day 9
- Read this text classification guide by Google Developers: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/
- Helped a friend with her first ML project, classification using Iris Dataset.
- Will continue work on Automated Question Answer Generation using SQuAD Dataset.

### Day 10
- Browsed various GitHub repositories
- Worked on Google's Text Classification guide and Neural QA.

### Day 11
- Completed work on Automated Question Generation.
- Read research on Fast and Easy Short Answer Grading with High Accuracy - http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1123
- Getting hands-on with statistical packages in Python.

### Day 12
- Read research on Neural Arithmetic Logic Units - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00508.pdf
