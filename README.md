# 100DaysOfMLCode

My journey through 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge

### Day 1
- Started working on Entity Extraction project.
- I will be using bi-LSTM + CRF with character embeddings for NER and POS.
- Reading: https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html
- Repo: https://github.com/partoftheorigin/EntityExtraction

### Day 2
- Almost done with Sequence Tagging.
- Repo: https://github.com/partoftheorigin/EntityExtraction/blob/master/LSTM_CRF_Twitter_NER.ipynb

### Day 3
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Research papers: 1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04560v2.pdf
2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf
3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01450.pdf

### Day 4
- Working on Automated Question Generation.
- Attended a Meetup on Getting to the Core of Deep Learning.
- Still understanding the underlying concepts and approaches of the research papers so that we can create our own model from scratch.
